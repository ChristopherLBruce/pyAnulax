# pyAnulax
PyQt Widget based on Rocket Racoon's anulax detonator from [Guardians of the Galaxy 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAciZRkOKQs)

Features:
- Functional LED timer to let the user know how much time they have to make a choice.
- A red button that the user can push.
- A second red button that the user SHOULD NOT PRESS!

This GUI currently doesn't do anything other than demonstrate one method for creating a simple graphic widget in PyQT
